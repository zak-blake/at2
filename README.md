About:

An art gallery that allows artists to log in and display artwork in albums



To Do:

Restrict user creation
Make the image#show page display full size of images + don't store unnecessary sizes of images
Implement the contact artist buttons
autofill the form when you add a new piece from the album page
add confirmations and required fields on forms and buttons




Later:

refactor the ordering system so make it easier to use
