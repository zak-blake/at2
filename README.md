## About

An art gallery that allows artists to log in and display artwork in albums

The Database is initialized empty, to create an admin user in the console:
'User.create!({:email => "admin@art.com", :admin => true, :full_name => 'Admin', :password => "password", :password_confirmation => "password" })'


## To Do

- Implement the contact artist buttons
- autofill the form when you add a new piece from the album page
- add confirmations to delete type buttons
- test account type things - reset password and so on.. (check formatting)
- add contact this artist on the pieces page
- sold image overlay
- navigate through each picture directly without going back to the album page
- artist#show page show all pieces not album thumbnails

## Later:

- redo the ordering system so make it easier to use
- stop users from downloading images
